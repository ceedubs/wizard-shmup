Wizard Shmup
============

Wizard Shmup is a simple HTML 5 Shoot 'Em Up game I created to play with the [Jaws](https://github.com/ippa/jaws) framework. Admittedly, calling it a "game" is a bit of a stretch so far.

To try playing it, you can either clone the repository and run it locally or simply [try it online](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/44327900/wizard_shmup/index.html).

Thanks to Adam Steffen for the concept art drawing that I attempted to turn into a vector image.
